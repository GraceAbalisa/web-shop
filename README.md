# Trello

For this project, I used the trello as usual. It helps me to stay organize and to know what I did and 
what remained for me to do 



# The  Mission (Team Work)

Freshshop is your new customer. They specialize in organic food and biodegradable bikes. Their store in Saint-Gilles is so profitable that they've opened another just below Thomas's apartment. To celebrate, they want to launch an e-commerce website at the same time.

Freshshop already owns the frontend part of the project. You must now implement the back-end with NodeJS or Php in OOP.
